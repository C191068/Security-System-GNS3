### Installing VMware Workstation Player <br> <br>

VMware Workstation Player, formerly VMware Player, is a virtualization software package for x64 computers running Microsoft Windows or Linux, supplied free of charge by VMware, Inc., a company which was formerly a division of, and whose majority shareholder remains, Dell EMC.

We will use VMware Player to run GNS3 VM in it. We need GNS3 VM to use Windows and Kali Linux appliances. There is a more popular option to use virtual machines which is VirtualBox. But to use appliances in GNS3 we need KVM / nested virtualization support. Even though VirtualBox supports KVM but the support was given to it very recently. So it doesn't support it natively it just simulates it. As a result the appliaces runs very slow in it.

But VMware supports KVM natively thus the appliances runs in it smoothly. That's why we will be using VMware.
