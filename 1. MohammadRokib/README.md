### Initial Setup <br> <br><br>

Assalmu Alaikum,
I'm Mohammad Rokib Khan. Me and my team is working on a project where we've built a security system on a topolgy inside GNS3 to protect it from **Cyber Attack**. I have worked on the initial setup of the project. Where I've done the followings:
<br>
- [x] Installing GNS3
- [x] Installing VMware Workstation Player
- [x] Installing GNS3 VM
- [x] Installing Windows 10, Kali Linux appliances in GNS
