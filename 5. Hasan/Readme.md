### Building the Topology <br> <br><br>

Assalmualaikum,
I'm Md Hasanur Rohoman Khan. Me and my team is working on a project where we've built a security system on a topolgy inside GNS3 to protect it from **Cyber Attack**. My responsibility was to secure our website from the Attack. I have secured the Website by doing the following:
<br>
- [x] Used a Cisco c7200 router
- [x] Applied static IP address on the router interfaces
- [x] Applied OSPF routing protocol on the router
- [x] Configured the router as a Firewall
- [x] Blocked the attack by denying all TCP request from the hacker PC
